# RLCD TODO

* Need to write a program to produce the items.js file from a given csv or tsv
  * Maybe in Node or Python?
* Use Bootstrap's dropdowns instead of selects
* Add a script file which contains item names
  * Perhaps we can tie into the Sheet, but unlikely
* Figure out what goes on the left and right
  * Progress on the left?
  * Selected item thumbnails on right?
* Teams should be a radio, but need a hidden element then
* Can we make the color chart clickable?
  * Background image on a table above it with links?
* Group parts together?
  * Part and paint on the same line (Body and Paint, etc.)
* Probably should use a template engine for HTML generation
* Further selection option should be hidden until we know the prerequisites
  * Maybe use BS Collapse?
* Use a autocomplete dropdown
  * jQuery has one, but does it work with bootstrap?
