# RLCD TODO

* Use Bootstrap's dropdowns instead of selects
* Add a script file which contains item names
  * Perhaps we can tie into the Sheet, but unlikely
* Figure out what goes on the left and right
  * Progress on the left?
* Teams should be a radio, but need a hidden element then
* Can we make the color chart clickable?
  * Background image on a table above it with links?
* Group parts together?
  * Part and paint on the same line (Body and Paint, etc.)
